	 *  - dependent  : which always depends on dependent
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Design issues
	 *  ------------------
	 *  1. Too many dependency class objects are created ..
	 *  	-> Per of application goes down, and hard to manage memory management
	 *  
	 *  Why this issue happened?
	 *  ---------------------------
	 *  -> Dependent class itself creating dependency class object.
	 *  
	 *  what is the solution?
	 *  -----------------------
	 *  -> do not create dependency object from dependent class directly
	 *  -> Instead use techniques like JNDI look up and all...
	 *  -> JNDI location is tightly coupled with dependent class.
